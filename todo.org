** TODO implement Helm but not globally
** TODO fix find file
   possibly just implement a different shortcut to create a file, or just remove IDO from find file
   since we have Projectile for smart finding

** TODO fix magit performance issues
** TODO strip out bare bones emacs config file for the office
** TODO implement more org-capture templates
** TODO fix auto complete
   only want to be able to opt in with tab etc
   so maybe prefer company over whatever else is trying to comlete (ivy?)

** TODO web mode sometimes just deactivates 
** TODO remove focus on notifications
** TODO fix positioning of notifications and konsole
** DONE find a way to stop company-mode from slowing doing shells or disable it with hooks
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:36]

** TODO remove line numbers from comint and like text files
   files/buffers above certain size basically

** DONE swiper for currently selected text
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:34]

** DONE swiper for word under cursor
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:34]

** TODO GOTO file under cursor
   I believe find-file (C-x C-f) used to work for this

** TODO snippets
   especially for rails (template if statements etc)

** TODO look into emacs server again
   could be very useful to run profiler in the background

** TODO thing at point
   projectile ag search
   find file
   find dir
   etc

** TODO schedule issues (todos) for particular days
   probably already possible, but make it easy-> shortcut

** DONE change the prev-buffer and next-buffer shortcuts
   it's /C-x p/ or /C-x r/ now
   CLOSED: [2020-04-22 Wed 10:48]
   it's currently C-x left /or/ right
   gotta be something requiring less stretch
   
** TODO make issues relatable
   add "epic" style issues so that issues can link to other issues
   or be depend on other issues ("blocking")

** TODO MEETINGS!!!
** TODO org mode stuff to check out
   https://github.com/ahungry/org-jira
   https://github.com/IvanMalison/org-projectile
   https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam

** TODO update doom-city-lights colour scheme
   replace some of the reds/pinks/oranges at the theme level instead of the way I'm doing it now
   
** TODO find a way to properly customize face, fonts, etc
** TODO make modules easier to include or exclude
   especially face - it should probably be an entirely empty file for newcomers

   maybe add a wizard for installation that asks about stuff like:
   ivy? (that probably includes company etc)
   capture?
   python?

   and also allows you to easily setup theme

** TODO fix robe so that it start automatically
   when entering a ruby project it should pick up the gemset (via RVM?) and environment for that project and start robe
   https://lorefnon.me/2014/02/02/configuring-emacs-for-rails.html

** TODO setting TODO on an item that doesn't have state should just default to TODO

** TODO find-file shortcut to just go to other window (if it exists) and open there else create one

** DONE timesheet slow
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:50]
   org-mode was slowed down by linum-mode
   should be using display-line-numbers-mode instead
** DONE refresh buffer not working. used to be F6
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:35]
