** TODO implement Helm but not globally
** TODO fix find file
   possibly just implement a different shortcut to create a file, or just remove IDO from find file
   since we have Projectile for smart finding
** TODO fix magit performance issues
** TODO strip out bare bones emacs config file for the office
** TODO implement more org-capture templates
** TODO fix auto complete
   only want to be able to opt in with tab etc
   so maybe prefer company over whatever else is trying to comlete (ivy?)
** TODO web mode sometimes just deactivates 
** TODO remove focus on notifications
** TODO fix positioning of notifications and konsole
** DONE find a way to stop company-mode from slowing doing shells or disable it with hooks

** TODO checkout old emacs rails setup guide
   https://lorefnon.me/2014/02/02/configuring-emacs-for-rails.html
** TODO remove line numbers from comint and like text files
   files/buffers above certain size basically
** DONE swiper for currently selected text
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:34]
** DONE swiper for word under cursor
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:34]
** TODO GOTO file under cursor
   I believe find-file (C-x C-f) used to work for this
** TODO snippets
   especially for rails (template if statements etc)
** TODO look into emacs server again
   could be very useful to run profiler in the background

** DONE timesheet slow
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:50]
   org-mode was slowed down by linum-mode
   should be using display-line-numbers-mode instead
** DONE refresh buffer not working. used to be F6
   CLOSED: [2020-03-10 Tue 00:35]
** TODO setup emacs shell for ssh and docker
this also needs to work when you use django shell inside docker container inside server connection
** FEEDBACK overwrite mode not working
** FEEDBACK need to remap or learn macros
** TODO warnings about imports not being used, etc are missing
** FEEDBACK learn magit
** TODO add pretier for js
