* TODO fix find file
  possibly just implement a different shortcut to create a file, or just remove IDO from find file
  since we have Projectile for smart finding
* TODO fix magit performance issues
* TODO strip out bare bones emacs config file for the office
* TODO implement more org-capture templates
* TODO fix auto complete
  only want to be able to opt in with tab etc
